Cautionable offences
A player is cautioned if guilty of:
• delaying the restart of play
• dissent by word or action
• entering, re-entering or deliberately leaving the field of play without the
referee’s permission
• failing to respect the required distance when play is restarted with a
dropped ball, corner kick, free kick or throw-in
• persistent offences (no specific number or pattern of offences constitutes
‘persistent’)
• unsporting behaviour
• entering the referee review area (RRA)
• excessively using the ‘review’ (TV screen) signal
A substitute or substituted player is cautioned if guilty of:
• delaying the restart of play
• dissent by word or action
• entering or re-entering the field of play without the referee’s permission
• unsporting behaviour
• entering the referee review area (RRA)
• excessively using the ‘review’ (TV screen) signal
Where two separate cautionable offences are committed (even in close
proximity), they should result in two cautions, for example if a player enters
the field of play without the required permission and commits a reckless tackle

There are different circumstances when a player must be cautioned for
unsporting behaviour, including if a player:
• attempts to deceive the referee, e.g. by feigning injury or pretending to have
been fouled (simulation)
• changes places with the goalkeeper during play or without the referee’s
permission (see Law 3)

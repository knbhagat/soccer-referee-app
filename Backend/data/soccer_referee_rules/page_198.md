In situations of mass confrontation, the nearest AR may enter the field of play
to assist the referee. The other AR must observe and record details of the
iRnecqidueirnetd. Tdhiset afonucreth official should remain in the vicinity of the technical areas.
When a free kick is awarded very close to the AR, the AR may enter the field
of play (usually at the request of the referee) to help ensure that the players
are positioned 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball. In this case, the referee must wait
uSnutbisl ttihteu tAioRn is back in position before restarting play.
If there is no fourth official, the AR moves to the halfway line to assist with the
substitution procedure; the referee must wait until the AR is back in position
before restarting play.
If there is a fourth official, the AR does not need to move to the halfway line
as the fourth official carries out the substitution procedure unless there are
several substitutions at the same time, in which case the AR moves to the
halfway line to assist the fourth official.

General modifications
The universality of the Laws of the Game means that the game is essentially
the same in every part of the world and at every level. As well as creating a
‘fair’ and safe environment in which the game is played, the Laws should also
promote participation and enjoyment.
Historically, The IFAB has allowed national football associations (FAs) some
flexibility to modify the ‘organisational’ Laws for specific categories of football.
The IFAB strongly believes that national FAs should be able to modify some
aspects of the way football is organised if it will benefit football in their own
country.
How the game is played and refereed should be the same on every football field
in the world, from the FIFA World Cup™ final to the smallest village. However,
the needs of a country’s domestic football should determine how long the game
lasts, how many people can take part and how some unfair behaviour is
punished.
All national FAs (and confederations and FIFA) have the option to modify all or
some of the following organisational areas of the Laws of the Game for football

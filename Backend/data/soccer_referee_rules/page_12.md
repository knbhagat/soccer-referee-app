There are also trials:
• to deal more effectively with goalkeepers who unfairly hold the ball for too
long
• in which the referee announces and explains the final decision after a video
assistant referee (VAR) ‘review’ or lengthy VAR ‘check’
The Laws cannot deal with every possible situation, so where there is no direct
provision in the Laws, The IFAB expects the referee to make a decision within
the ‘spirit’ of the game and the Laws – this often involves asking the question,
‘what would football want/expect?’
The Laws must also contribute to the safety and welfare of players and it is
The IFAB’s responsibility to react quickly and appropriately to support the
game’s participants, through the Laws themselves, when the need arises.
Following successful trials, the use of ‘additional permanent concussion
substitutions’ has now been incorporated as a competition option in the Laws.
This will allow teams to prioritise the welfare of a player who has an actual or
suspected concussion without suffering a numerical disadvantage.
Accidents inevitably occur, but the Laws aim to help make the game as safe as
possible, balancing player welfare and sporting fairness. This requires referees
to use the Laws to deal strongly with those players whose actions are too
aggressive or dangerous. The Laws embody the unacceptability of unsafe play
in their disciplinary phrases, such as ‘reckless challenge’ and ‘endangering the
safety of an opponent’ or ‘using excessive force’.
To promote a greater understanding of the Laws, The IFAB has published
‘Football Rules – simplified Laws of the Game’, which have been written to make
the Laws easier to understand, especially for young people, potential or newly
qualified referees, adults who referee occasionally, players, coaches (including
thosew wwowrk.fionogt tboawllarurdless a. ccoomaching qualification), spectators and the media.

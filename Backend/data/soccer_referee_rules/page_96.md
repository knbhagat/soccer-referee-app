• An eligible player may change places with the goalkeeper
• The kick is completed when the ball stops moving, goes out of play or the
referee stops play for any offence; the kicker may not play the ball a second time
• The referee keeps a record of the kicks
• If the goalkeeper commits an offence and, as a result, the kick is retaken,
the goalkeeper is warned for the first offence and cautioned for any
subsequent offence(s)
• If the kicker is penalised for an offence committed after the referee has
signalled for the kick to be taken, that kick is recorded as missed and the
kicker is cautioned
• If both the goalkeeper and the kicker commit an offence at the same time,

• The kicks are taken alternately by the teams
• Each kick is taken by a different player, and all eligible players must take a
kick before any player can take a second kick
• If, before both teams have taken five kicks, one has scored more goals than the
other could score, even if it were to complete its five kicks, no more kicks are taken
• If, after both teams have taken five kicks, the scores are level, kicks continue
until one team has scored a goal more than the other from the same number
of kicks
• The above principle continues for any subsequent sequence of kicks but a
team may change the order of kickers
• Penalties (penalty shoot-out) must not be delayed for a player who leaves
the field of play. The player’s kick will be forfeited (not scored) if the player

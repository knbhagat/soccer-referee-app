Delaying the restart of play to show a card
Once the referee has decided to caution or send off a player, play must not be
restarted until the sanction has been administered, unless the non-offending
team takes a quick free kick, has a clear goal-scoring opportunity and the
referee has not started the disciplinary sanction procedure. The sanction is
administered at the next stoppage; if the offence was denying the opposing
team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the player is cautioned; if the offence
iAndtevrafnerteadg ewith or stopped a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.
If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/
sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/
sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the
offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity,
the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offence was interfering
with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.
Advantage should not be applied in situations involving serious foul play,
violent conduct or a second cautionable offence unless there is a clear
opportunity to score a goal. The referee must send off the player when the ball
is next out of play, but if the player plays the ball or challenges/interferes with
an opponent, the referee will stop play, send off the player and restart with an
indirect free kick, unless the player committed a more serious offence.
If a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues
holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.

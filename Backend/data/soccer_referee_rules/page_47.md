All balls used in matches played in an official competition organised under the
auspices of FIFA or confederations must meet the requirements and bear one
of the marks of the FIFA Quality Programme for Footballs.
Each mark indicates that the ball has been officially tested and meets the
specific technical requirements for that mark which are additional to the
minimum specifications stipulated in Law 2 and must be approved by
The IFAB.
National FA competitions may require the use of balls bearing one of these
marks.
In matches played in an official competition organised under the auspices
of FIFA, confederations or national FAs, no form of commercial advertising is
permitted on the ball, except for the logo/emblem of the competition, the
competition organiser and the authorised manufacturer’s trademark. The
competition regulations may restrict the size and number of such markings.

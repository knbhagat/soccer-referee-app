The Start and
Restart of Play
A kick-off starts both halves of a match, both halves of extra time and restarts
play after a goal has been scored. Free kicks (direct or indirect), penalty kicks,
throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks are other restarts (see Laws 13–17).
A dropped ball is the restart when the referee stops play and the Law does not
require one of the above restarts.
If an offence occurs when the ball is not in play, this does not change how
play is restarted.
1. Kick-off
Procedure
• the referee tosses a coin and the team that wins the toss decides which goal
to attack in the first half or to take the kick-off
• depending on the above, their opponents take the kick-off or decide which
goal to attack in the first half
• the team that decided which goal to attack in the first half takes the kick-off
to start the second half
• for the second half, the teams change ends and attack the opposite goals
• after a team scores a goal, the kick-off is taken by their opponents
For every kick-off:
• all players, except the player taking the kick-off, must be in their own half
of the field of play
• the opponents of the team taking the kick-off must be at least 9.15 m
(10 yds) from the ball until it is in play
• the ball must be stationary on the centre mark
• the referee gives a signal
• the ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves

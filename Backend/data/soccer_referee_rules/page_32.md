Substitution opportunities
• Making a ‘concussion substitution’ is separate from any limit on the number
of ‘normal substitution’ opportunities.
• However, if a team makes a ‘normal substitution’ at the same time as a
‘concussion substitution’, this will count as one of its ‘normal substitution’
opportunities.
• Once a team has used all its ‘normal substitution’ opportunities, it cannot use
a ‘concussion substitution’ to make a ‘normal substitution’.
• Where a team makes a ‘concussion substitution’, the opposing team can use
an ‘additional substitute’ and receives an ‘additional substitution’
opportunity. This additional opportunity can be used only for the ‘additional
Mastucbhs toiftfuicteia’ lasnd not for a ‘normal substitute’.
The referee and other match officials, especially the fourth official:
• are not part of a team’s decision-making process as to whether a player
should be substituted or not, nor whether a player should be replaced by a
‘normal substitute’ or a ‘concussion substitute’;
• must not decide whether an actual or suspected injury qualifies for a
‘concussion substitute’ to be used;
• should give appropriate support where a player has an actual or suspected
injury, including by informing the team captain, coach and/or medical staff if
they suspect that a player needs to be assessed and/or treated;
• should support a decision by the team captain, coach and/or medical staff
that an injured player cannot continue playing, which may require the
referee to delay the restart until after the player has left the field of play; and
• must inform the appropriate authorities if there are concerns that a
‘concussion substitution’ has been made inappropriately.

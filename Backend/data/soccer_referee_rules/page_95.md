Procedure
Before penalties (penalty shoot-out) start
• Unless there are other considerations (e.g. ground conditions, safety etc.),
the referee tosses a coin to decide the goal at which the kicks will be taken,
which may only be changed for safety reasons or if the goal or playing
surface becomes unusable
• The referee tosses a coin again, and the team that wins the toss decides
whether to take the first or second kick
• With the exception of a substitute for a goalkeeper who is unable to continue,
only players who are on the field of play or are temporarily off the field of
play (injury, adjusting equipment etc.) at the end of the match are eligible to
take kicks
• Each team is responsible for selecting from the eligible players the order in
which they will take the kicks. The referee is not informed of the order
• If at the end of the match and before or during the kicks one team has a
greater number of players than its opponents, it must reduce its numbers to
the same number as its opponents and the referee must be informed of the
name and number of each player excluded. Any excluded player is not eligible
to take part in the kicks (except as outlined below)
• A goalkeeper who is unable to continue before or during the kicks may be
replaced by a player excluded to equalise the number of players or, if their
team has not used its maximum permitted number of substitutes, a named
substitute, but the replaced goalkeeper takes no further part and may not
take a kick
• If the goalkeeper has already taken a kick, the replacement may not take a

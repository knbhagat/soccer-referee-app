2. Compulsory equipment
•
The compulsory equipment of a player comprises the following separate items:
(…)
Goalkeepers may wear tracksuit bottoms.
4. Other equipment
(…)
Non-dangerous protective equipment, for example gloves, headgear, facemasks
and knee and arm protectors made of soft, lightweight padded material is
permitted, as are goalkeepers’ caps and sports spectacles. Goalkeepers may wear
tracksuit bottoms.
Explanation
Reference to gloves has been included under ‘Other equipment’ to reflect the fact

bottoms for goalkeepers has been removed from ‘Compulsory equipment’ and

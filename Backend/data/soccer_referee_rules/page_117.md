• reckless – caution the offender for unsporting behaviour
• using excessive force – send off the offender for violent conduct
4. Restart of play after fouls and misconduct
If the ball is out of play, play is restarted according to the previous decision.
If the ball is in play and a player commits a physical offence inside the field of
play against:
• an opponent – an indirect or direct free kick or penalty kick
• a team-mate, substitute, substituted or sent-off player, team official or a
match official – a direct free kick or penalty kick
All verbal offences are penalised with an indirect free kick.
If the referee stops play for an offence committed by a player, inside or outside
the field of play, against an outside agent, play is restarted with a dropped ball,
unless an indirect free kick is awarded for leaving the field of play without the
referee’s permission; the indirect free kick is taken from the point on the
boundary line where the player left the field of play.
If, when the ball is in play:
• a player commits an offence against a match official or an opposing player,
substitute, substituted or sent-off player, or team official outside the field of
play or
• a substitute, substituted or sent-off player, or team official commits an
offence against, or interferes with, an opposing player or a match official
outside the field of play,
play is restarted with a free kick on the boundary line nearest to where the
offence/interference occurred; for direct free kick offences, a penalty kick is
awarded if this is within the offender’s penalty area.
If an offence is committed outside the field of play by a player against a player,
substitute, substituted player or team official of their own team, play is
restarted with an indirect free kick on the boundary line closest to where the
offence occurred.

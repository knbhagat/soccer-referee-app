play (including goal/no goal); normal speed should be used for the ‘intensity’
of an offence or to decide if it was a handball offence
• For decisions/incidents relating to goals, penalty/no penalty and red cards
for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO), it may be
necessary to review the attacking phase of play which led directly to the
decision/incident; this may include how the attacking team gained
possession of the ball in open play
• The Laws of the Game do not allow restart decisions (corner kicks, throw-ins
etc.) to be changed once play has restarted, so they cannot be reviewed
• If play has stopped and restarted, the referee may only undertake a ‘review’,
and take the appropriate disciplinary sanction, for a case of mistaken
identity or for a potential sending-off offence relating to violent conduct,
spitting, biting or extremely offensive, insulting and/or abusive action(s)
• The review process should be completed as efficiently as possible, but the
accuracy of the final decision is more important than speed. For this reason,
and because some situations are complex with several reviewable decisions/
Fininacl iddeecnitssi,o tnhere is no maximum time limit for the review process
• When the review process is completed, the referee must show the ‘TV signal’
and communicate the final decision
• The referee will then take/change/rescind any disciplinary action (where

• As the VAR will automatically ‘check’ every situation/incident, there is no
need for coaches or players to request a ‘ ’ or ‘ ’
• Players, substitutes and team officials must not attempt to influence
or interfere with the review process, including when the final decision is
communicated
• During the review process, players should remain on the field of play;
substitutes and team officials should remain off the field of play

Principles
• Each team is permitted to use a maximum of one ‘concussion substitute’ in a
match.
• A ‘concussion substitution’ may be made regardless of the number of
substitutes already used.
• In competitions in which the number of named substitutes is the same as the
maximum number of ‘normal substitutes’ that can be used, the ‘concussion
substitute’ can be a player who has previously been substituted and may be
used at any time, regardless of the number of substitutes already used.
• When a ‘concussion substitute’ is used, the opposing team then has the
Proopcetidounr eto use an ‘additional substitute’ for any reason.
• The substitution procedure operates in accordance with Law 3 – The Players
(except as outlined otherwise below).
• A• ‘concussion substitution’ may be made:
•
immediately after a concussion occurs or is suspected;
•
after an on-field assessment and/or an off-field assessment; or
at any other time when a concussion occurs or is suspected, including
when a player has previously been assessed and has returned to the field
of play.
• If a team decides to make a ‘concussion substitution’, the referee/fourth
official is informed, ideally by using a substitution card/form of a different
colour.
• The player with concussion or suspected concussion is not permitted to take
any further part in the match, including penalties (penalty shoot-out), and
should, where possible, be accompanied to the dressing room and/or a
medical facility.
• The opposing team is informed by the referee/fourth official that it has the
option of using an ‘additional substitute’ and an ‘additional substitution’
opportunity, which may be used concurrently with the ‘concussion
substitution’ made by the other team or at any time thereafter (except as
outlined otherwise in the Laws of the Game).

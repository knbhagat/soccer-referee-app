Guidelines for temporary dismissals (sin bins) (pp. 24–27)
The guidelines have been revised and the main changes are as follows:
•
To help manage temporary dismissals, a temporarily dismissed player can
return to the field of play only during a stoppage after the end of the
•
temporary dismissal period, i.e. not while the ball is in play
If a temporary dismissal period is not completed at the end of the first half of
extra time, it continues at the start of the second half of extra time
(a temporary dismissal period cannot continue after the end of the second half
of extra time, since temporary dismissals are not used in penalties (penalty
•
shoot-out))
System B, which uses temporary dismissals as an additional sanction for
specific offences only, has been simplified so that any two cautionable offences
•
in the same match will result in the player being (permanently) sent off (RC)
‘Handball’ has been changed to ‘deliberate handball’ in the list of offences that
might be suitable for a temporary dismissal if they stop or interfere with
a promising attack (System B)

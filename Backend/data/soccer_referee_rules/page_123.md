3. Offences and sanctions
If, when a free kick is taken, an opponent is closer to the ball than the required
distance, the kick is retaken unless the advantage can be applied; but if a player
takes a free kick quickly and an opponent who is less than 9.15 m (10 yds) from
the ball intercepts it, the referee allows play to continue. However, an opponent
who deliberately prevents a free kick being taken quickly must be cautioned
for delaying the restart of play.
If, when a free kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd)
from a ‘wall’ formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free
kick is awarded.
If, when a free kick is taken by the defending team inside its penalty area, any
opponents are inside the penalty area because they did not have time to leave,
the referee allows play to continue. If an opponent who is in the penalty area
when the free kick is taken, or enters the penalty area before the ball is in play,
touches or challenges for the ball before it is in play, the free kick is retaken.
If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has
touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the kicker commits
a handball offence:
• a direct free kick is awarded
• a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the kicker’s penalty
area unless the kicker was the goalkeeper in which case an indirect free kick
is awarded

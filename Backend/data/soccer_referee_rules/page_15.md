The future
The IFAB will carry on its work with its advisory panels and its extensive
consultation efforts, with a continued focus on player welfare, improving
participant behaviour and making the game fairer and more attractive to take
part in and watch.
It is also important to maintain the ‘universality’ of the Laws so that young
players can watch matches on television and then go out and try to recreate
what they have seen.
The IFAB greatly enjoys engaging with people throughout the world and we are
always very pleased to receive suggestions or questions relating to the Laws of
the Game.

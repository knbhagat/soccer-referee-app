10. Goals
A goal must be placed on the centre of each goal line.
A goal consists of two vertical posts equidistant from the corner flagposts
and joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The goalposts and crossbar must
be made of approved material and must not be dangerous. The goalposts and
crossbar of both goals must be the same shape, which must be square,
rectangular, round, elliptical or a hybrid of these options.
It is recommended that all goals used in an official competition organised
under the auspices of FIFA or confederations meet the requirements of the
FIFA Quality Programme for Football Goals.
The distance between the inside of the posts is 7.32 m (8 yds) and the distance
from the lower edge of the crossbar to the ground is 2.44 m (8 ft).
The position of the goalposts in relation to the goal line must be in accordance
with the graphics.
The goalposts and the crossbar must be white and have the same width and
depth, which must not exceed 12 cm (5 ins).
If the crossbar becomes displaced or broken, play is stopped until it has been
repaired or replaced in position. Play is restarted with a dropped ball. If it
cannot be repaired the match must be abandoned. A rope or any flexible or
dangerous material may not replace the crossbar.
Nets may be attached to the goals and the ground behind the goal; they must
bSea fpertoyperly supported and must not interfere with the goalkeeper.
Goals (including portable goals) must be firmly secured to the ground.
11. Goal line technology (GLT)
GLT systems may be used to verify whether a goal has been scored to support
the refereeâ€™s decision.
The use of GLT must be stipulated in the competition rules.

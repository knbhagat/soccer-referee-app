Introduction
These guidelines contain practical advice for match officials which
supplements the information in the Laws of the Game section.
Reference is made in Law 5 to referees operating within the framework of the
Laws of the Game and the ‘spirit of the game’. Referees are expected to use
common sense and to apply the ‘spirit of the game’ when applying the Laws of
the Game, especially when making decisions relating to whether a match takes
place and/or continues.
This is especially true for the lower levels of football where it may not always
be possible for the Law to be strictly applied. For example, unless there are
safety issues, the referee should allow a game to start/continue if:
• one or more corner flags are missing
• there is a minor inaccuracy with the markings on the field of play such as
the corner area, centre circle etc.
• the goalposts/crossbar are not white
In such cases, the referee should, with the agreement of the teams, play/
continue the match and must submit a report to the appropriate authorities.
Key:
• AR = assistant referee
• AAR = additional assistant referee

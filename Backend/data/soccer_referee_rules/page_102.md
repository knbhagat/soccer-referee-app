purposes of offside until the next stoppage in play or until the defending team
has played the ball towards the halfway line and it is outside its penalty area. If
the player left the field of play deliberately, the player must be cautioned when
the ball is next out of play.
An attacking player may step or stay off the field of play not to be involved in
active play. If the player re-enters from the goal line and becomes involved in
play before the next stoppage in play or the defending team has played the
ball towards the halfway line and it is outside its penalty area, the player
will be considered to be positioned on the goal line for the purposes of offside.
A player who deliberately leaves the field of play and re-enters without the
refereeâ€™s permission and is not penalised for offside and gains an advantage
must be cautioned.
If an attacking player remains stationary between the goalposts and inside
the goal as the ball enters the goal, a goal must be awarded unless the player
commits an offside offence or a Law 12 offence, in which case play is restarted
with an indirect or direct free kick.

3. Practicalities
The use of VARs during a match involves the following practical arrangements:
• The VAR watches the match in the video operation room (VOR) assisted by
one or more assistant VARs (AVARs)
• Depending on the number of camera angles and other considerations, there
may be more than one AVAR and one or more replay operators (ROs)
• Only authorised persons are allowed to enter the VOR or communicate with
the VAR/AVAR/RO during the match
• The VAR has independent access to, and replay control of, TV broadcast
footage
• The VAR is connected to the communication system being used by the match
officials and can hear everything they say; the VAR can only speak to the
referee by pushing a button (to avoid the referee being distracted by
conversations in the VOR)
• If the VAR is busy with a ‘check’ or a ‘review’, the AVAR may speak to the
referee, especially if the game needs to be stopped or to ensure play does
not restart
• If the referee decides to view the replay footage, the VAR will select the best
angle/replay speed; the referee can request other/additional angles/speeds
4. Procedures
Original decision
• The referee and other match officials must always make an initial decision
(including any disciplinary action) as if there was no VAR (except for a
‘missed’ incident)
• The referee and other match officials are not permitted to give ‘no decision’
as this will lead to ‘weak/indecisive’ officiating, too many ‘reviews’ and
significant problems if there is a technology failure
• The referee is the only person who can make the final decision; the VAR has
the same status as the other match officials and can only assist the referee

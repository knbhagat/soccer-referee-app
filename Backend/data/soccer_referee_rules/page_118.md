If a player makes contact with the ball with an object (boot, shinguard etc.)
held in the hand, play is restarted with a direct free kick (or penalty kick).
If a player who is on or off the field of play throws or kicks an object (other
than the match ball) at an opposing player, or throws or kicks an object
(including a ball) at an opposing substitute, substituted or sent-off player, team
official, or a match official or the match ball, play is restarted with a direct free
kick from the position where the object struck or would have struck the person
or the ball. If this position is off the field of play, the free kick is taken on the
nearest point on the boundary line; a penalty kick is awarded if this is within
the offenderâ€™s penalty area.
If a substitute, substituted or sent-off player, player temporarily off the field of
play or team official throws or kicks an object onto the field of play and it
interferes with play, an opponent or match official, play is restarted with a
direct free kick (or penalty kick) where the object interfered with play or
struck or would have struck the opponent, match official or the ball.

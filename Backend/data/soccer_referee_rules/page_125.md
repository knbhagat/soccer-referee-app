The Penalty Kick
A penalty kick is awarded if a player commits a direct free kick offence inside
their penalty area or off the field as part of play as outlined in Laws 12 and 13.
A goal may be scored directly from a penalty kick.
1. Procedure
The ball must be stationary, with part of the ball touching or overhanging the
centre of the penalty mark, and the goalposts, crossbar and goal net must not
be moving.
The player taking the penalty kick must be clearly identified.
The defending goalkeeper must remain on the goal line, facing the kicker,
between the goalposts, until the ball is kicked. The goalkeeper must not behave
in a way that unfairly distracts the kicker, e.g. delay the taking of the kick or
touch the goalposts, crossbar or goal net.
The players other than the kicker and goalkeeper must be:
• at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the penalty mark
• behind the penalty mark
• inside the field of play
• outside the penalty area
After the players have taken positions in accordance with this Law, the referee
signals for the penalty kick to be taken.
The player taking the penalty kick must kick the ball forward; backheeling is
permitted provided the ball moves forward.
When the ball is kicked, the defending goalkeeper must have at least part of
one foot touching, in line with, or behind, the goal line.

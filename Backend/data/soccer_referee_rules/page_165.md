Explanation
Non-deliberate handball offences are usually the result of a player attempting to
play fairly, so when a penalty kick is awarded for such offences, the same
philosophy should apply as for offences (fouls) which are an attempt to play the
ball or a challenge for the ball, i.e. DOGSO offences result in a yellow card and
SPA offences result in no card. Deliberate handball remains a red-card offence
when a penalty kick is awarded, as it is similar to holding, pulling, pushing, no
possibility to play the ball etc.
Law 14 – The Penalty Kick (p. 125)
1. Procedure
Amended text
The ball must be stationary, on with part of the ball touching or overhanging the
centre of the penalty mark, and the goalposts, crossbar and goal net must not be
moving.
Explanation
Clarification regarding the ball position for a penalty kick, as there can be
disputes and/or delays, especially when the penalty mark is not a ‘spot’. Part of
the ball must touch or overhang the centre of the penalty mark (just as the ball
must be inside the corner area, including overhanging the corner arc, at a corner
kick). As with other positional matters, if ground conditions dictate a slight
change, this is a decision for the referee.

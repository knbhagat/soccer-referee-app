The Goal Kick
A goal kick is awarded when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line,
on the ground or in the air, having last touched a player of the attacking team,
and a goal is not scored.
A goal may be scored directly from a goal kick, but only against the opposing
team; if the ball directly enters the kicker’s goal, a corner kick is awarded to
the opponents.
1. Procedure
• The ball must be stationary and is kicked from any point within the goal
area by a player of the defending team
• The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
• Opponents must be outside the penalty area until the ball is in play
2. Offences and sanctions
If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has
touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the kicker commits
a handball offence:
• a direct free kick is awarded
• a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the kicker’s penalty
area, unless the kicker was the goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick
is awarded
If, when a goal kick is taken, any opponents are inside the penalty area because
they did not have time to leave, the referee allows play to continue. If an
opponent who is in the penalty area when the goal kick is taken, or enters the
penalty area before the ball is in play, touches or challenges for the ball before
it is in play, the goal kick is retaken.

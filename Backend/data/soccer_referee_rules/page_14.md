Managing changes
to the Laws
Football must remain attractive and enjoyable for players, match officials and
coaches, as well as spectators, fans and administrators, regardless of age,
gender, race, religion, culture, ethnicity, sexual orientation or disability.
Therefore, for a Law to be changed, The IFAB and all its bodies that are
involved in the decision-making process must be convinced that the change
will benefit the game; this sometimes means that the potential change needs to
be tested and/or trialled.
For every proposed change, the focus is on fairness, integrity, respect, safety,
the enjoyment of participants and spectators and, where appropriate, using
technology to enhance the game.
The IFAB will continue to engage with the global football community so that
changes to the Laws benefit football at all levels and in every corner of the
world, and so that the integrity of the game, the Laws and the match officials
are respected, valued and protected.

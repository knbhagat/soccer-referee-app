injury
substitution
The whistle is NOT needed to:
• s•top play for a clear:
goal kick, corner kick, throw-in or goal
• r•estart play from:
most free kicks, and a goal kick, corner kick, throw-in or dropped ball
A whistle which is used too frequently/unnecessarily will have less impact
when it is needed.
If the referee wants the player(s) to wait for the whistle before restarting play
(e.g. when ensuring that defending players are 9.15m (10 yd) from the ball at a
free kick) the referee must clearly inform the attacking player(s) to wait for the
whistle.
If the referee blows the whistle in error and play stops, play is restarted with a
dropped ball.
2. Assistant referees
Beep signal
The beep signal system is an additional signal which is only used to gain the
referee’s attention. Situations when the signal beep may be useful include:
• offside
• offences (outside the view of the referee)
•E lethctrroown-iicn c, ocomrmneurn kicicakti, ogno asly ksitcekm or goal (tight decisions)
Where an electronic communication system is used, the referee will advise the
ARs as to when it may be appropriate to use the communication system with,
or instead of, a physical signal.

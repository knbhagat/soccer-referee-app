Fouls outside the penalty area
When a foul is committed by a defender outside the penalty area (near the
boundary of the penalty area), the AR should make eye contact with the
referee, to see the referee’s position and what action has been taken, and signal
with the flag if necessary. In counter-attack situations, the AR should be able
to give information such as whether or not a foul has been committed and
whether a foul was committed inside or outside the penalty area, and what
disciplinary action should be taken. The AR should make a clear movement
along the touchline towards the halfway line to indicate when the offence took
pGloaacle – o nuots gidoea lt he penalty area.
When it is clear that the ball has wholly passed over the goal line in the goal,
the AR must make eye contact with the referee without giving any additional
signal.
When a goal has been scored but it is not clear whether the ball has passed
over the line, the AR must first raise the flag to attract the referee’s attention

The first action of the AR for an offside decision is to raise the flag (using the
right hand, giving the AR a better line of vision) and then, if the referee stops
play, use the flag to indicate the area of the field of play in which the offence
occurred. If the flag is not immediately seen by the referee, the AR must
maintain the signal until it has been acknowledged or the ball is clearly in the
cPoenntarlotyl o kfi cthke defending team.
If the goalkeeper blatantly moves off the goal line before the ball is kicked and
prevents a goal from being scored, the AR should indicate the encroachment

Once the AR has been informed (by the fourth official or team official) that a
substitution is requested, the AR must signal this to the referee at the next
stoppage.

Protocol –
principles, practicalities
and procedures
The VAR protocol, as far as possible, conforms to the principles and philosophy
of the Laws of the Game.
The use of video assistant referees (VARs) is only permitted where the match/
competition organiser has fulfilled all the Implementation Assistance and
Approval Programme (IAAP) requirements as set out in FIFA’s IAAP documents,
and has received written permission from FIFA.
1. Principles
The use of VARs in football matches is based on a number of principles, all of
which must apply in every match using VARs.
1. A video assistant referee (VAR) is a match official, with independent
clear and obvious error serious missed incident
access to match footage, who may assist the referee only in the event of a
‘a. Goal/no goal ’ or ‘ ’ in relation to:
b. Penalty/no penalty
c. Direct red card (not second yellow card/caution)
d. Mistaken identity (when the referee cautions or sends off the
wrong player of the offending team)
2. The referee must always make a decision, i.e. the referee is not permitted to
give ‘no decision’ and then use the VAR to make the decision; a decision to
allow play to continue after an alleged offence can be reviewed.
3. The original decision given by the referee will not be changed unless
the video review clearly shows that the decision was a ‘clear and
obvious error’.

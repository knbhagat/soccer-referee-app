A named substitute who is sent off before or after the kick-off may not be
replaced.
7. Extra persons on the field of play
The coach and other officials named on the team list (with the exception of
players or substitutes) are team officials. Anyone not named on the team list as
a player, substitute or team official is an outside agent.
If a team official, substitute, substituted or sent-off player or outside agent
enters the field of play, the referee must:
• only stop play if there is interference with play
• have the person removed when play stops
• take appropriate disciplinary action
If play is stopped and the interference was by:
• a team official, substitute, substituted or sent-off player, play restarts with a
direct free kick or penalty kick
• an outside agent, play restarts with a dropped ball
If a ball is going into the goal and the interference does not prevent a defending
player playing the ball, the goal is awarded if the ball enters the goal (even if
contact was made with the ball) unless the interference was by the attacking
team.
8. Player outside the field of play
If a player who requires the referee’s permission to re-enter the field of play
re-enters without the referee’s permission, the referee must:
• stop play (not immediately if the player does not interfere with play
or a match official or if the advantage can be applied)
• caution the player for entering the field of play without permission
If the referee stops play, it must be restarted:
• with a direct free kick from the position of the interference
• with an indirect free kick from the position of the ball when play was
stopped if there was no interference

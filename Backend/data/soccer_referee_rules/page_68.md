Outside interference
• stops, suspends or abandons the match for any offences or because of
o•utside interference e.g. if:
•
the floodlights are inadequate
an object thrown by a spectator hits a match official, a player or team
official, the referee may allow the match to continue, or stop, suspend or
•
abandon it depending on the severity of the incident
a spectator blows a whistle which interferes with play – play is stopped
•
and restarted with a dropped ball
an extra ball, other object or animal enters the field of play during the
match, the referee must:
– stop play (and restart with a dropped ball) only if it interferes with play
– unless the ball is going into the goal and the interference does not
prevent a defending player playing the ball; the goal is awarded if the
ball enters the goal (even if contact was made with the ball) unless the
interference was by the attacking team
– allow play to continue if it does not interfere with play and have it
removed at the earliest possible opportunity
• allows no unauthorised persons to enter the field of play
4. Video assistant referee (VAR)
The use of video assistant referees (VARs) is only permitted where the match/
competition organiser has fulfilled all Implementation Assistance and Approval
Programme (IAAP) requirements as set out in FIFA’s IAAP documents, and has
received written permission from FIFA.
The referee may be assisted by a video assistant referee (VAR) only in the event
of a ‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed incident’ in relation to:
• goal/no goal
• penalty/no penalty
• direct red card (not second caution)
• mistaken identity when the referee cautions or sends off the wrong player of
the offending team

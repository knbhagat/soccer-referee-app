3. Additional assistant referees
The additional assistant referees may indicate:
• when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, including when
a goal is scored
• which team is entitled to a corner kick or goal kick
• whether, at penalty kicks, the goalkeeper moves off the goal line before
the ball is kicked and if the ball crosses the line
4. Reserve assistant referee
A reserve assistant referee may replace an assistant referee, fourth official or
additional assistant referee who is unable to continue, and may also assist the
referee in the same way as the other ‘on-field’ match officials.
5. Video match officials
A video assistant referee (VAR) is a match official who may assist the referee to
make a decision using replay footage only for a ‘clear and obvious error’ or
‘serious missed incident’ relating to a goal/no goal, penalty/no penalty, direct
red card (not a second caution) or a case of mistaken identity when the referee
cautions or sends off the wrong player of the offending team.
An assistant video assistant referee (AVAR) is a match official who helps the
VAR primarily by:
• watching the television footage while the VAR is busy with a ‘check’ or
a ‘review’
• keeping a record of VAR-related incidents and any communication or
technology problems
• assisting the VAR’s communication with the referee, especially
communicating with the referee when the VAR is undertaking a ‘check’/
‘review’, e.g. to tell the referee to ‘stop play’ or ‘delay the restart’ etc.
• recording the time ‘lost’ when play is delayed for a ‘check’ or a ‘review’
• communicating information about a VAR-related decision to relevant parties

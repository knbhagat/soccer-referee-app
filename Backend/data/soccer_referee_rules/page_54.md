5. Offences and sanctions
If a named substitute starts a match instead of a named player and the
referee is not informed of this change:
• the referee allows the named substitute to continue playing
• no disciplinary action may be taken against the named substitute
• the named player can become a named substitute
• the number of substitutions is not reduced
• the referee reports the incident to the appropriate authorities
If a substitution is made during the half-time interval or before extra time,
the procedure must be completed before the match restarts. If the referee is
not informed, the named substitute may continue to play, no disciplinary
action is taken and the matter is reported to the appropriate authorities.
If a player changes places with the goalkeeper without the referee’s
permission, the referee:
• allows play to continue
• cautions both players when the ball is next out of play but not if the change
occurred during half-time (including half-time of extra time) or the period
between the end of the match and the start of extra time and/or penalties
(penalty shoot-out)
For any other offences:
• the players are cautioned
• play is restarted with an indirect free kick, from the position of the ball when
play was stopped
6. Players and substitutes sent off
A player who is sent off:
• before submission of the team list cannot be named on the team list in
any capacity
• after being named on the team list and before kick-off may be replaced by a
named substitute, who cannot be replaced; the number of substitutions the
team can make is not reduced
• after the kick-off cannot be replaced

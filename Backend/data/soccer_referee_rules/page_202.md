Flag technique
The AR’s flag must always be unfurled and visible to the referee. This usually
means the flag is carried in the hand closest to the referee. When making a
signal, the AR stops running, faces the field of play, makes eye contact with the
referee and raises the flag with a deliberate (not hasty or exaggerated) motion.
The flag should be like an extension of the arm. The ARs must raise the flag
using the hand that will be used for the next signal. If circumstances change
and the other hand must be used, the AR should move the flag to the opposite
hand below the waist. If the AR signals that the ball is out of play, the signal
must be maintained until the referee acknowledges it.
If the AR signals for a sending-off offence and the signal is not seen
immediately:
• if play has been stopped, the restart may be changed in accordance with the
Laws (free kick, penalty kick, etc.)
• if play has restarted, the referee may still take disciplinary action but not

As a general rule, the AR should not use obvious hand signals. However, in
some instances, a discreet hand signal may assist the referee. The hand signal
should have a clear meaning which should have been agreed in the pre-match

When the ball wholly passes over the goal line, the AR raises the flag with the
right hand (better line of vision) to inform the referee that the ball is out of
play and then if it is:
• near to the AR – indicate whether it is a goal kick or a corner kick
• far from the AR – make eye contact and follow the referee’s decision
When the ball clearly passes over the goal line, the AR does not need to raise
the flag to indicate that the ball has left the field of play. If the goal kick or

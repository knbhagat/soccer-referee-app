2. Offences and sanctions
If, after the ball is in play, the thrower touches the ball again before it has
touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the thrower
commits a handball offence:
• a direct free kick is awarded
• a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the thrower’s penalty
area unless the ball was handled by the defending team’s goalkeeper, in
which case an indirect free kick is awarded
An opponent who unfairly distracts or impedes the thrower (including moving
closer than 2m (2yds) to the place where the throw-in is to be taken) is
cautioned for unsporting behaviour, and if the throw-in has been taken, an
indirect free kick is awarded.
For any other offence, the throw-in is taken by a player of the opposing team.

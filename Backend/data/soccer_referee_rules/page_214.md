5. Injuries
The safety of the players is of paramount importance and the referee should
facilitate the work of the medical personnel, especially in the case of a serious
injury and/or an assessment of a head injury. This will include respecting and
assisting with agreed assessment/treatment protocols.
6. Treatment/assessment after a caution/sending-off
Previously, an injured player who received medical attention on the field of
play had to leave before the restart. This can be unfair if an opponent caused
the injury as the offending team has a numerical advantage when play restarts.
However, this requirement was introduced because players often unsportingly
used an injury to delay the restart for tactical reasons.
As a balance between these two unfair situations, The IFAB has decided that
only for a physical offence where the opponent is cautioned or sent off, an
injured player can be quickly assessed/treated and then remain on the field of
play.
In principle, the delay should not be any longer than currently occurs when a
medical person(s) comes onto the field to assess an injury. The difference is
that the point at which the referee used to require the medical person(s) and
the player to leave is now the point at which the medical staff leave but the
player can remain.
To ensure the injured player does not use/extend the delay unfairly, referees
are advised to:
• be aware of the match situation and any potential tactical reason to delay the
restart
• inform the injured player that if medical treatment is required it must be
quick
• signal for the medical person(s) (not the stretchers) and, if possible, remind
them to be quick

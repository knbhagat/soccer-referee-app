T he Other
Match Officials
Other match officials (two assistant referees, a fourth official, two additional
assistant referees, a reserve assistant referee, a video assistant referee (VAR)
and at least one assistant VAR (AVAR)) may be appointed to matches. They will
assist the referee in controlling the match in accordance with the Laws of the
Game but the final decision will always be taken by the referee.
The referee, assistant referees, fourth official, additional assistant referees and
reserve assistant referee are the ‘on-field’ match officials.
The VAR and AVAR are the ‘video’ match officials (VMOs) and assist the referee
in accordance with the Laws of the Game and the VAR protocol.
The match officials operate under the direction of the referee. In the event
of undue interference or improper conduct, the referee will relieve them of
their duties and make a report to the appropriate authorities.
The other ‘on-field’ match officials assist the referee with offences when they
have a clearer view than the referee and they must submit a report to the
appropriate authorities on any serious misconduct or other incident that
occurred out of the view of the referee and the other match officials. They must
advise the referee and other match officials of any report being made.
The ‘on-field’ match officials assist the referee with inspecting the field of play,
the balls and players’ equipment (including if problems have been resolved)
and maintaining records of time, goals, misconduct etc.
Competition rules must state clearly who replaces a match official who is
unable to start or continue and any associated changes. In particular, it must
be clear whether, if the referee is unable to start or continue, the fourth official
or the senior assistant referee or senior additional assistant referee takes over.

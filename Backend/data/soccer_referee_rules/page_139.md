The Corner Kick
A corner kick is awarded when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line,
on the ground or in the air, having last touched a player of the defending team,
and a goal is not scored.
A goal may be scored directly from a corner kick, but only against the opposing
team; if the ball directly enters the kicker’s goal, a corner kick is awarded to
the opponents.
1. Procedure
• The ball must be placed in the corner area nearest to the point where the
ball passed over the goal line
• The ball must be stationary and is kicked by a player of the attacking team
• The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves; it does not need to
leave the corner area
• The corner flagpost must not be moved
• Opponents must remain at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the corner arc until
the ball is in play
2. Offences and sanctions
If, after the ball is in play, the kicker touches the ball again before it has
touched another player, an indirect free kick is awarded; if the kicker commits
a handball offence:
• a direct free kick is awarded
• a penalty kick is awarded if the offence occurred inside the kicker’s penalty
area, unless the kicker was the goalkeeper, in which case an indirect free kick
is awarded

• free kicks for offences involving a player entering, re-entering or leaving
the field of play without permission are taken from the position of the ball
when play was stopped. However, if a player commits an offence off the field
of play, play is restarted with a free kick taken on the boundary line nearest
to where the offence occurred; for direct free kick offences, a penalty kick is
awarded if this is within the offender’s penalty area
• where the Law designates another position (see Laws 3, 11, 12)
The ball:
• must be stationary and the kicker must not touch the ball again until it has
touched another player
• is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves
Until the ball is in play, all opponents must remain:
• at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the ball, unless they are on their own goal line
between the goalposts
• outside the penalty area for free kicks inside the opponents’ penalty area
Where three or more defending team players form a ‘wall’, all attacking team
players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the ‘wall’ until the ball is in play.
A free kick can be taken by lifting the ball with a foot or both feet
simultaneously.
Feinting to take a free kick to confuse opponents is permitted as part of
football.
If a player, while correctly taking a free kick, deliberately kicks the ball at
an opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or reckless
manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.

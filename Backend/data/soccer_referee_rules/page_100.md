opponent.
*‘Deliberate play’ (excluding deliberate handball) is when a player has control
of the ball with the possibility of:
• passing the ball to a team-mate;
• gaining possession of the ball; or
• clearing the ball (e.g. by kicking or heading it)

the ball is inaccurate or unsuccessful, this does not negate the fact that the
player ‘deliberately played’ the ball.

• The ball was not moving quickly
• The direction of the ball was not unexpected
• The player had time to coordinate their body movement, i.e. it was not a case

a team-mate of the player taking the penalty kick is penalised for
encroachment only if:
· the encroachment clearly impacted on the goalkeeper; or
· the encroaching player plays the ball or challenges an opponent for the ball
•
and then scores, attempts to score or creates a goal-scoring opportunity
a team-mate of the goalkeeper is penalised for encroachment only if:

· the encroaching player plays the ball or challenges an opponent for the ball
and this prevents the opponents from scoring, attempting to score or

Explanation
Player encroachment can be difficult to detect and manage, especially at the
lower levels of the game, where there may be no neutral assistant referees.
However, it can easily be identified by the video assistant referee, and if Law 14
were to be applied strictly, most penalty kicks would be retaken. Since
encroachment rarely affects the outcome of the kick (only if the ball rebounds
into play), the same principle should apply to player encroachment as to
goalkeeper encroachment, i.e. it is penalised only if it has an impact.

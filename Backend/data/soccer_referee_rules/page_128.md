If, after the penalty kick has been taken:
• t•he kicker touches the ball again before it has touched another player:
an indirect free kick (or direct free kick for a handball offence) is awarded
• t•he ball is touched by an outside agent as it moves forward:
the kick is retaken unless the ball is going into the goal and the interference
does not prevent the goalkeeper or a defending player playing the ball, in
which case the goal is awarded if the ball enters the goal (even if contact was
made with the ball) unless the interference was by the attacking team
• the ball rebounds into the field of play from the goalkeeper, the crossbar or
t•he goalposts and is then touched by an outside agent:
•
the referee stops play
play is restarted with a dropped ball at the position where it touched the
outside agent

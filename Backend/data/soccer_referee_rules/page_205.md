Throw-in
When the ball wholly passes over the touchline:
• near to the AR – a direct signal should be made to indicate the direction of
the throw-in
• far from the AR and the throw-in decision is an obvious one – the AR must
make a direct signal to indicate the direction of the throw-in
• far from the AR and the AR is in doubt about the direction of the throw-in
– the AR must raise the flag to inform the referee that the ball is out of play,
make eye contact with the referee and follow the referee’s signal
3. Additional assistant referees
The AARs use a radio communication system (not flags) to communicate with
the referee. If the radio communication system fails to work, the AARs will use
an electronic signal beep flagstick. AARs do not usually use obvious hand
signals but, in some instances, a discreet hand signal may give valuable support
to the referee. The hand signal should have a clear meaning and such signals
should be agreed in the pre-match discussion.
The AAR, having assessed that the ball has wholly passed over the goal line
within the goal, must:
• immediately inform the referee via the communication system that a goal
should be awarded
• make a clear signal with the left arm perpendicular to the goal line pointing
towards the centre of the field (flagstick in the left hand is also required).
This signal is not required when the ball has very clearly passed over the
goal line
The referee will make the final decision.

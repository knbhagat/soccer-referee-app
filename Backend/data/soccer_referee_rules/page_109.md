ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player themself) and includes
preventing a nearby opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury.
A scissors or bicycle kick is permissible provided that it is not dangerous to

Impeding the progress of an opponent means moving into the opponent’s path
to obstruct, block, slow down or force a change of direction when the ball is not
within playing distance of either player.
All players have a right to their position on the field of play; being in the way
of an opponent is not the same as moving into the way of an opponent.
A player may shield the ball by taking a position between an opponent and the
ball if the ball is within playing distance and the opponent is not held off with
the arms or body. If the ball is within playing distance, the player may be fairly
charged by an opponent.
3. Disciplinary action
The referee has the authority to take disciplinary action from entering the field
of play for the pre-match inspection until leaving the field of play after the
match ends (including penalties (penalty shoot-out)).
If, before entering the field of play at the start of the match, a player or team
official commits a sending-off offence, the referee has the authority to prevent
the player or team official taking part in the match (see Law 3.6); the referee
will report any other misconduct.
A player or team official who commits a cautionable or sending-off offence,
either on or off the field of play, is disciplined according to the offence.

3.2 Number of substitutions – Return substitutions
The use of return substitutions is only permitted in youth, veterans, disability
and grassroots football, subject to the agreement of the national football
association, confederation or FIFA.
A ‘return substitute’ is a player who has already played in the match and has
been substituted (a substituted player) and later in the match returns to play
by replacing another player.
Apart from the dispensation for a substituted player to return to play in the
match, all other provisions of Law 3 and the Laws of the Game apply to return
substitutes. In particular, the substitution procedure outlined in Law 3
must be followed.

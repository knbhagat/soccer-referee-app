4. Only the referee can initiate a ‘review’; the VAR (and other match officials)
can only recommend a ‘review’ to the referee.
5. The final decision is always taken by the referee, either based on
information from the VAR or after the referee has undertaken an ‘on-field
review’ (OFR).
6. There is no time limit for the review process as accuracy is more important
than speed.
7. The players and team officials must not surround the referee or attempt to
influence if a decision is reviewed, the review process or the final decision.
8. The referee must remain ‘visible’ during the review process to ensure
transparency.
9. If play continues after an incident which is then reviewed, any disciplinary
action taken/required during the post-incident period is not cancelled,
even if the original decision is changed (except a caution/sending-off for
stopping or interfering with a promising attack or DOGSO).
10. If play has stopped and been restarted, the referee may not undertake a
‘review’ except for a case of mistaken identity or for a potential sending-off
offence relating to violent conduct, spitting, biting or extremely offensive,
insulting and/or abusive action(s).
11. The period of play before and after an incident that can be reviewed is
determined by the Laws of the Game and VAR protocol.
12. As the VAR will automatically ‘check’ every situation/decision, there is no
need for coaches or players to request a ‘review’.
2. Reviewable match-changing decisions/incidents
The referee may receive assistance from the VAR only in relation to four
after the referee has made a (first/original) decision
categories of match-changing decisions/incidents. In all these situations, the
VAR is only used
(including allowing play to continue), or if a serious incident is missed/not
seen by the match officials.
The referee’s original decision will not be changed unless there was a ‘clear
and obvious error’ (this includes any decision made by the referee based on
information from another match official e.g. offside).

The Throw-in
A throw-in is awarded to the opponents of the player who last touched the
ball when the whole of the ball passes over the touchline, on the ground or
in the air.
A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in:
• if the ball enters the opponents’ goal – a goal kick is awarded
• if the ball enters the thrower’s goal – a corner kick is awarded
1. Procedure
At the moment of delivering the ball, the thrower must:
• stand facing the field of play
• have part of each foot on the touchline or on the ground outside the
touchline
• throw the ball with both hands from behind and over the head from
the point where it left the field of play
All opponents must stand at least 2 m (2 yds) from the point on the touchline
where the throw-in is to be taken.
The ball is in play when it enters the field of play. If the ball touches the
ground before entering, the throw-in is retaken by the same team from the
same position. If the throw-in is not taken correctly, it is retaken by the
opposing team.
If a player, while correctly taking a throw-in, deliberately throws the ball at an
opponent in order to play the ball again but not in a careless or a reckless
manner or using excessive force, the referee allows play to continue.
The thrower must not touch the ball again until it has touched another player.

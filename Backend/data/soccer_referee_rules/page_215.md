When the referee decides play should restart, either:
• the medical person(s) leaves and the player remains or
• the player leaves for further assessment/treatment (stretcher signal may be
necessary)
As a general guide, the restart should not be delayed for more than about
20–25 seconds beyond the point when everyone was ready for play to restart,
except in the case of a serious injury and/or an assessment of a head injury.
The referee must make full allowance for the stoppage.

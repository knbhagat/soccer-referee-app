Review
• The referee can initiate a ‘review’ for a potential ‘clear and obvious error’ or
‘•serious missed incident’ when:
•
the VAR (or another match official) recommends a ‘review’
the referee suspects that something serious has been ‘missed’
• If play has already stopped, the referee delays the restart
• If play has not already stopped, the referee stops play when the ball is next in
a neutral zone/situation (usually when neither team is in an attacking move)
and shows the ‘TV signal’
• The VAR describes to the referee what can be seen on the TV replay(s) and
t•he referee then:
shows the ‘TV signal’ (if not already shown) and goes to the referee review
area to view replay footage – ‘on-field review’ (OFR) – before making a
final decision. The other match officials will not review the footage unless,
or
in exceptional circumstances, asked to do so by the referee
•
makes a final decision based on the referee’s own perception and the
information from the VAR, and, where appropriate, input from other match
officials – ‘VAR-only review’
• At the end of both review processes, the referee must show the ‘TV signal’
immediately followed by the final decision
• For subjective decisions, e.g. intensity of a foul challenge, interference at
offside, handball considerations, an ‘on-field review’ (OFR) is appropriate
• For factual decisions, e.g. position of an offence or player (offside), point of
contact (handball/foul), location (inside or outside the penalty area), ball out
of play etc. a ‘VAR-only review’ is usually appropriate but an ‘on-field review’
(OFR) can be used for a factual decision if it will help manage the players/
match or ‘sell’ the decision (e.g. a crucial match-deciding decision late in the
game)
• The referee can request different cameras angles/replay speeds but, in
general, slow-motion replays should only be used for facts, e.g. position of
offence/player, point of contact for physical offences and handball, ball out of

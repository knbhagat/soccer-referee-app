Other advice
1. Advantage
The referee may play advantage whenever an offence occurs but should
consider the following in deciding whether to apply the advantage or stop
play:
• the severity of the offence – if the offence warrants a sending-off, the
referee must stop play and send off the player unless there is a clear
opportunity to score a goal
• the position where the offence was committed – the closer to the
opponent’s goal, the more effective the advantage can be
• the chances of an immediate, promising attack
• the atmosphere of the match
2. Allowance for time lost
Many stoppages in play are entirely natural (e.g. throw-ins, goal kicks).
An allowance is made only when delays are excessive.
3. Holding an opponent
Referees are reminded to make an early intervention and to deal firmly with
holding offences, especially inside the penalty area at corner kicks and free
kicks. To deal with these situations:
• the referee must warn any player holding an opponent before the ball
is in play
• caution the player if the holding continues before the ball is in play
• award a direct free kick or penalty kick and caution the player if it
happens once the ball is in play

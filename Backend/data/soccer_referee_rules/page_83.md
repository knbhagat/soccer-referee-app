The Duration of
the Match
1. Periods of play
A match lasts for two equal halves of 45 minutes, which may only be reduced
if agreed between the referee and the two teams before the start of the match
and if in accordance with competition rules.
2. Half-time interval
Players are entitled to an interval at half-time, not exceeding 15 minutes;
a short drinks break (which should not exceed one minute) is permitted at the
interval of half-time in extra time. Competition rules must state the duration of
the half-time interval and it may be altered only with the referee’s permission.
3. Allowance for time lost
Allowance is made by the referee in each half for all playing time lost in that
half through:
• substitutions
• assessment and/or removal of injured players
• wasting time
• disciplinary sanctions
• medical stoppages permitted by competition rules, e.g. ‘drinks’ breaks
(which should not exceed one minute) and ‘cooling’ breaks (ninety seconds
to three minutes)
• delays relating to VAR ‘checks’ and ‘reviews’
• goal celebrations
• any other cause, including any significant delay to a restart
(e.g. due to interference by an outside agent)

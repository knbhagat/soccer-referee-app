For youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football:
• size of the field of play
• size, weight and material of the ball
• width between the goalposts and height of the crossbar from the ground
• duration of the two (equal) halves of the game (and two equal halves of
extra time)
• number of players
• use of return substitutes
• use of temporary dismissals (sin bins) for some/all cautions (YCs)
• specific requirements for the captain’s compulsory armband
In addition, to allow national FAs further flexibility to benefit and develop their
domestic football, the following changes relating to ‘categories’ of football are
permitted:
• national FAs, confederations and FIFA have the flexibility to decide the age
restrictions for youth and veterans football
• each national FA will determine which competitions at the lowest levels of
Thfeo oIFtAbaBl’ls a trreia dless ignated as ‘grassroots’ football
There are times when a potential Law change needs to be tested or trialled to
evaluate both the expected and unexpected impacts that it may have on the
game. Confederations, national FAs and competition organisers must have
permission from The IFAB to take part in any such trials.
In 2024/25, The IFAB’s trials will include:
• The use of a captain-only zone around the referee in certain situations
• The use of official cooling-off periods following some confrontation
situations
• A different approach to dealing with the goalkeeper holding the ball for too
long
• The referee announcing and explaining the final decision after a VAR ‘review’
or lengthy VAR ‘check’

6. Offences and sanctions
For any offence, play need not be stopped and the player:
• is instructed by the referee to leave the field of play to correct the equipment
• leaves when play stops, unless the equipment has already been corrected
A player who leaves the field of play to correct or change equipment must:
• have the equipment checked by a match official before being allowed to
re-enter
• only re-enter with the referee’s permission (which may be given during play)
A player who enters without permission must be cautioned, and if play is
stopped to issue the caution, an indirect free kick is awarded from the position
of the ball when play was stopped, unless there was interference, in which case
a direct free kick (or penalty kick) is awarded from the position of the
interference.

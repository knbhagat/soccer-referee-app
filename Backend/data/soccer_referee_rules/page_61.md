Players (including substitutes/substituted and sent-off players) are not

Where wearable technology (WT) as part of electronic performance and
tracking systems (EPTS) is used in matches played in an official competition
organised under the auspices of FIFA, confederations or national football
associations, the competition organiser must ensure that the technology
attached to the players’ equipment is not dangerous and meets the
requirements for wearable EPTS under the FIFA Quality Programme for EPTS.
Where EPTS are provided by the match or competition organiser, it is the
responsibility of that match or competition organiser to ensure that the
information and data transmitted from EPTS to the technical area during
matches played in an official competition are reliable and accurate.
The FIFA Quality Programme for EPTS supports competition organisers with
the approval process of reliable and accurate electronic performance and
tracking systems.

Principles of GLT
GLT applies solely to the goal line and is only used to determine whether a goal
has been scored.
The indication of whether a goal has been scored must be immediate and
automatically confirmed within one second by the GLT system only to the match
officials (via the referee’s watch, by vibration and visual signal, and/or via the
rReefqerueiere’sm eeanrptsie acen/dh sepaedcseifti)c;a itt imonasy oalfs Go LbTe sent to the video operation room (VOR).
If GLT is used in competition matches, the competition organisers must ensure
that the system (including any potentially permitted modifications to the goal
frame or technology in the ball) meets the requirements of the FIFA Quality
Programme for GLT.
Where GLT is used, the referee must test the technology’s functionality before
the match as set out in the Testing Manual. If the technology does not function
in accordance with the Testing Manual, the referee must not use the GLT
system and must report this to the appropriate authorities.
12. Commercial advertising
No form of commercial advertising, whether real or virtual, is permitted on
the field of play, on the ground within the area enclosed by the goal nets, the
technical area or the referee review area (RRA), or on the ground within 1m
(1yd) of the boundary lines from the time the teams enter the field of play until
they have left it at half-time and from the time the teams re-enter the field of
play until the end of the match. Advertising is not permitted on the goals, nets,
flagposts or their flags and no extraneous equipment (cameras, microphones,
etc.) may be attached to these items.
In addition, upright advertising must be at least:
• 1 m (1 yd) from the touchlines
• the same distance from the goal line as the depth of the goal net
• 1 m (1 yd) from the goal net

Determining the
Outcome of a Match
1. Goal scored
A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between
the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no offence has been
committed by the team scoring the goal.
If the goalkeeper throws the ball directly into the opponents’ goal, a goal kick is
awarded.
If a referee signals a goal before the ball has passed wholly over the goal line,
play is restarted with a dropped ball.
2. Winning team
The team scoring the greater number of goals is the winner. If both teams score
no goals or an equal number of goals, the match is drawn.
When competition rules require a winning team after a drawn match or
home-and-away tie, the only permitted procedures to determine the winning
team are:
• away goals rule
• two equal periods of extra time not exceeding 15 minutes each
• penalties (penalty shoot-out)
A combination of the above procedures may be used.
3. Penalties (penalty shoot-out)
Penalties (penalty shoot-out) are taken after the match has ended and unless
otherwise stated, the relevant Laws of the Game apply. A player who has been
sent off during the match is not permitted to take part; warnings and cautions
issued to players and team officials during the match are not carried forward
into penalties (penalty shoot-out).

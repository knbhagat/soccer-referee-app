Movement of the ball
An attacker (C) is in an offside position, not interfering with an opponent, when a
team-mate (A) passes the ball to player (B1) in an onside position who runs
towards the opponentsâ€™ goal and passes the ball (B2) to team-mate (C).
Attacker (C) was in an onside position when the ball was passed, so cannot be

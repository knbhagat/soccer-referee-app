The kicker must not play the ball again until it has touched another player.
The penalty kick is completed when the ball stops moving, goes out of play or
the referee stops play for any offence.
Additional time is allowed for a penalty kick to be taken and completed at the
end of each half of the match or extra time. When additional time is allowed,

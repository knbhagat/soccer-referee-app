Positioning of assistant referees and additional assistant referees
The AR must be in line with the second-last defender or the ball if it is nearer
to the goal line than the second-last defender. The AR must always face the
field of play, even when running. Side-to-side movement should be used for
short distances. This is especially important when judging offside as it gives
the AR a better line of vision.
The AAR position is behind the goal line except where it is necessary to move
onto the goal line to judge a goal/no goal situation. The AAR is not allowed to
enter the field of play unless there are exceptional circumstances.

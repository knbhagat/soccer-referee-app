Positioning, movement
and teamwork
1. General positioning and movement
The best position is one from which the referee can make the correct
decision. All recommendations about positioning must be adjusted using
specific information about the teams, the players and events in the match.
The positions recommended in the graphics are basic guidelines. The
recommended positions are areas within which the referee is likely to be
most effective. These areas may be larger, smaller or differently shaped

• The play should be between the referee and the lead AR
• The lead AR should be in the referee’s field of vision so the referee should
usually use a wide diagonal system
• Staying towards the outside of the play makes it easier to keep play and
the lead AR in the referee’s field of vision
• The referee should be close enough to see play without interfering with
play
• ‘What needs to be seen’ is not always in the vicinity of the ball. The referee
s•hould also pay attention to:
•
player confrontations off the ball
•
possible offences in the area towards which play is moving
offences occurring after the ball is played away

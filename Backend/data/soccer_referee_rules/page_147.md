a very clear
attacking situation
• Delaying the flag/whistle for an offence is only permissible in
when a player is about to score a goal or has a clear run
into/towards the opponents’ penalty area
• If an assistant referee delays a flag for an offence, the assistant referee must
raise the flag if the attacking team scores a goal, is awarded a penalty kick,
free kick, corner kick or throw-in, or retains possession of the ball after the
initial attack has ended; in all other situations, the assistant referee should
decide whether or not to raise the flag, depending on the requirements of the
Chgeacmke
• The VAR automatically ‘checks’ the TV camera footage for every potential
or actual goal, penalty or direct red card decision/incident, or a case of
mistaken identity, using different camera angles and replay speeds
• The VAR can ‘check’ the footage in normal speed and/or in slow motion but,
in general, slow-motion replays should only be used for facts, e.g. position of
offence/player, point of contact for physical offences and handball, ball out of
play (including goal/no goal); normal speed should be used for the ‘intensity’
of an offence or to decide if it was a handball offence
• If the ‘check’ does not indicate a ‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed
incident’, there is usually no need for the VAR to communicate with the
referee – this is a ‘silent check’; however, it sometimes helps the referee/
assistant referee to manage the players/match if the VAR confirms that no
‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed incident’ occurred
• If the restart of play needs to be delayed for a ‘check’, the referee will signal
this by clearly holding a finger to the earpiece/headset and extending the
other hand/arm; this signal must be maintained until the ‘check’ is complete
as it announces that the referee is receiving information (which may be from
the VAR or another match official)
• If the ‘check’ indicates a probable ‘clear and obvious error’ or ‘serious missed
incident’, the VAR will communicate this information to the referee, who will
then decide whether or not to initiate a ‘review’

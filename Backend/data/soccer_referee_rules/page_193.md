Goal kick
The AR must first check if the ball is inside the goal area. If the ball is not
placed correctly, the AR must not move from the position and must make eye
contact with the referee and raise the flag. Once the ball is placed correctly
inside the goal area, the AR must take a position to check the offside line.
However, if there is an AAR, the AR should take up a position in line with the
offside line and the AAR must be positioned at the intersection of the goal
line and the goal area, and check if the ball is placed inside the goal area.
If the ball is not placed correctly, the AAR must communicate this to the
referee.

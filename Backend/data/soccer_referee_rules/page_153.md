FIFA Quality
Programme
The FIFA Quality Programme sets criteria, based on well-founded research, for
products, playing surfaces and technologies used in the game of football. In
addition to mandatory quality requirements in some fields of application,
uniform recommendations are offered in other areas, on the basis of which
competition organisers can further specify their own regulations.
Independent testing institutes verify the functionality of the products, playing
surfaces and technologies in accordance with the respective standard. The
institutes conducting these tests are subject to the approval of FIFA. The
following quality marks identify those products, playing surfaces and
technologies tested and certified to the prevailing requirements:
FIFA Basic*
The test requirements for this standard are designed to identify products that
fulfil basic performance, accuracy, safety and durability criteria for football.
The focus is on setting minimum standards while ensuring affordability for use

playing surfaces and technologies more than for the FIFA Basic standard. Basic
performance and accuracy criteria are tested, but the main focus is on ensuring
extensive use.

The Field of Play
1. Field surface
The field of play must be a wholly natural or, if competition rules permit,
a wholly artificial playing surface except where competition rules permit an
integrated combination of artificial and natural materials (hybrid system).
The colour of artificial surfaces must be green.
Where artificial surfaces are used in competition matches between
representative teams of national football associations affiliated to FIFA or
international club competition matches, the surface must meet the
requirements of the FIFA Quality Programme for Football Turf, unless special
dispensation is given by The IFAB.
2. Field markings
The field of play must be rectangular and marked with continuous lines which
must not be dangerous; artificial playing surface material may be used for the
field markings on natural fields if it is not dangerous. These lines belong to the
areas of which they are boundaries.
Only the lines indicated in Law 1 are to be marked on the field of play. Where
artificial surfaces are used, other lines are permitted provided they are a
different colour and clearly distinguishable from the football lines.
The two longer boundary lines are touchlines. The two shorter lines are
goal lines.
The field of play is divided into two halves by a halfway line, which joins the
midpoints of the two touchlines.
The centre mark is at the midpoint of the halfway line. A circle with a radius
of 9.15m (10yds) is marked around it.

The philosophy and spirit
of the Laws
Football is the greatest sport on earth. It is played on every continent, in every
country and at many different levels. The fact that the Laws of the Game are the
same for all football throughout the world, from the FIFA World Cup™ through
to a game between young children in a remote village, is a considerable
strength which must continue to be harnessed for the good of football
everywhere.
Football must have Laws which keep the game fair – this is a crucial foundation
of the ‘beautiful game’ and a vital feature of the ‘spirit’ of the game. The best
matches are those where the referee is rarely needed because the players play
with respect for each other, the match officials and the Laws.
Football’s Laws are relatively simple compared to most other team sports, but
as many situations are subjective and match officials are human, some
decisions will inevitably be wrong or cause debate and discussion. For some
people, this discussion is part of the game’s enjoyment and attraction but,
whether decisions are right or wrong, the ‘spirit’ of the game requires that
referees’ decisions must always be respected. All those in authority, especially
coaches and team captains, have a clear responsibility to the game to respect
the match officials and their decisions.
Poor participant behaviour is an area of great concern, and it is essential that
everyone involved in the game be treated with respect. The IFAB has approved
the following trials with the aim of improving participant behaviour, which are
available to competitions that do not involve teams from the top two domestic
levels or senior ‘A’ international teams:
• cooling-off periods after incidents of confrontation
• referees being able to establish a captain-only zone to reduce/prevent
incidents of players crowding and/or mobbing them

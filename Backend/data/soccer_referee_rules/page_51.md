The Players
1. Number of players
A match is played by two teams, each with a maximum of eleven players;
one must be the goalkeeper. A match may not start or continue if either team
has fewer than seven players.
If a team has fewer than seven players because one or more players has
deliberately left the field of play, the referee is not obliged to stop play and
the advantage may be played, but the match must not resume after the ball has
gone out of play if a team does not have the minimum number of seven players.
If the competition rules state that all players and substitutes must be named
before kick-off and a team starts a match with fewer than eleven players,
only the players and substitutes named on the team list may take part in the
match upon their arrival.
2. Number of substitutions
Official competitions
The number of substitutes, up to a maximum of five, which may be used in
any match played in an official competition will be determined by FIFA,
the confederation or the national football association. For men’s and women’s
st
competitions involving the 1 teams of clubs in the top division or senior ‘A’
international teams where competition rules permit a maximum of five
substitutes to be used, each team:
• has a maximum of three substitution opportunities*
• *W mhaeyre a bdodtihti otenaamllys mmaakkee as usbusbtsittiututitoionns aatt hthaelf s-taimmee time, this will count as a
used substitution opportunity for both teams. Multiple substitutions (and
requests) by a team during the same stoppage in play count as one used
substitution opportunity.

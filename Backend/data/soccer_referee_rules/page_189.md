Consultation
When dealing with disciplinary issues, eye contact and a basic discreet hand
signal from the AR to the referee may be sufficient. When direct consultation
is required, the AR may advance 2–3 metres onto the field of play if necessary.
When talking, the referee and AR should both face the field of play to avoid
bCeoirnnge rh keaicrkd by others and to observe the players and field of play.
The AR’s position for a corner kick is behind the corner flag in line with the
goal line but the AR must not interfere with the player taking the corner kick
and must check that the ball is properly placed in the corner area.

• The length of the temporary dismissal is the same for all offences
• The length of the temporary dismissal should be 10–15% of the total playing

match)

has left the field of play

for a stoppage for which ‘additional time’ will be allowed at the end of the
half (e.g. substitution, injury, goal celebration, etc.)

period – it could be the responsibility of a delegate, fourth official or neutral
assistant referee; conversely it could be a team official

return from the touchline with the referee’s permission, when the ball is next
out of play
• The referee has the final decision as to when the player can return
• A temporarily dismissed player can only be substituted after the temporary
dismissal period has ended (and only if the team has not used all its
permitted substitutes and/or substitution opportunities, if applicable)
• If a temporary dismissal period has not been completed at the end of the
first half, the remaining period is served from the start of the second half;
this also applies in extra time
• If a temporary dismissal period has not been completed at the end of the
second half when extra time is to be played, the remaining period is served
from the start of extra time

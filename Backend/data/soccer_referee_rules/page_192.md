Goal/no goal
When a goal has been scored and there is no doubt about the decision, the
referee and assistant referee must make eye contact and the assistant referee
must then move quickly 25–30 metres along the touchline towards the halfway
line without raising the flag.
When a goal has been scored but the ball appears still to be in play, the
assistant referee must first raise the flag to attract the referee’s attention then
continue with the normal goal procedure of running quickly 25–30 metres
along the touchline towards the halfway line.
On occasions when the whole of the ball does not cross the goal line and
play continues as normal because a goal has not been scored, the referee must
make eye contact with the assistant referee and if necessary give a discreet
hand signal.
